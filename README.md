RC-Hack
=======

RC Hack, written in the Arduino programming language.


## Quick setup guide

Easy setup will be found in every realese as binary.

## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, RC-Hack will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
